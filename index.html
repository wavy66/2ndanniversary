        <p class="love-note">
            Two years ago, you walked into my life and turned my world into something more beautiful than I ever imagined.  
            From the first day, you brought warmth, love, and a kind of happiness I never knew existed.  
            Every moment with you is a treasure, every laugh we share is a melody, and every touch of yours is a reminder that love is the most magical thing in this world.  
        </p>
        <p class="love-note">
            Through the ups and downs, you’ve always been my greatest strength. You see the best in me even when I struggle to see it myself.  
            Your love, your kindness, and your presence make every single day worth living.  
            I promise to always cherish you, to stand by you, and to love you even more with each passing day.  
        </p>
        <p class="love-note">
            Thank you for being the most amazing part of my life. I love you more than words can ever express, and I will continue to love you for the rest of my days.  
            Happy 2nd Anniversary, my dearest love. ❤️
